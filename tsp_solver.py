    Solve TSP to optimality with dynamic programming.
    Parameters
    ----------
    distance_matrix
        Distance matrix of shape (n x n) with the (i, j) entry indicating the
        distance from node i to j. It does not need to be symmetric
    maxsize
        Parameter passed to ``lru_cache`` decorator. Used to define the maximum
        size for the recursion tree. Defaults to `None`, which essentially
        means "take as much space as needed".
    Returns
    -------
    permutation
        A permutation of nodes from 0 to n that produces the least total
        distance
    distance
        The total distance the optimal permutation produces

    Algorithm: cost of the optimal path
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Consider a TSP instance with 3 nodes: {0, 1, 2}. Let dist(0, {1, 2}) be the
    distance from 0, visiting all nodes in {1, 2} and going back to 0. This can
    be computed recursively as:
        dist(0, {1, 2}) = min(
            c_{0, 1} + dist(1, {2}),
            c_{0, 2} + dist(2, {1}),
        )
    wherein c_{0, 1} is the cost from going from 0 to 1 in the distance matrix.
    The inner dist(1, {2}) is computed as:
        dist(1, {2}) = min(
            c_{1, 2} + dist(2, {}),
        )
    and similarly for dist(2, {1}). The stopping point in the recursion is:
        dist(2, {}) = c_{2, 0}.
    This process can be generalized as:
        dist(ni, N) =   min   ( c_{ni, nj} + dist(nj, N - {nj}) )
                      nj in N
    and
        dist(ni, {}) = c_{ni, 0}
    With starting point as dist(0, {1, 2, ..., tsp_size}). The notation
    N - {nj} is the difference operator, meaning set N without node nj.
    Algorithm: compute the optimal path
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    The previous process returns the distance of the optimal path. To find the
    actual path, we need to store in a memory the following key/values:
        memo[(ni, N)] = nj_min
    with nj_min the node in N that provided the smallest value of dist(ni, N).
    Then, the process goes backwards starting from
    memo[(0, {1, 2, ..., tsp_size})].
    In the previous example, suppose memo[(0, {1, 2})] = 1.
    Then, look for memo[(1, {2})] = 2.
    Then, since the next step would be memo[2, {}], stop there. The optimal
    path would be 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0.
